# My Smart switch
This project implements a smart switch based on Atmega328 that has the following requirements:

- Must fit into a wall switch case box
- Must be as less invasive as possible. Which means I did not want to change anything in my electrical installation, e.g to change my regular switches to push button switches.
- The physical switch must be available and functional (you don't want your wife to be angry with you because she can't open a light without her cellphone ;) )
- Even if my smart switch is blocked or dead, the physical switch must still work

Here is the way the Smart switch is to be connected with the 3 way physical switch

For the full description of this project, please consult [this post on my website](https://www.laurentcarlier.com/2018/04/My-smart-switch-project.html).

I also have 2 videos. The first one showing the project operating a small LED without any problem. The second video shows the
project operating a regular light bulb, but with problems.

On the second video, the power supply (HPK-PM01) was not in used yet. The power is provided by the 5V serial connector.

I do not have any idea yet what the problem is. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have a clue of what the problem can be. I'm most likely missing something related to high voltages and noise.

Enjoy!
